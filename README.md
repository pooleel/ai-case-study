# Artificial Intelligence in Banking
    ## Origins
    Zest AI

    Zest AI was started in 2009. The current CEO is Mike de Vere. It was stared based upon a need to create standard underwriting procedures and/or fraud detection in the lending process.

    ## Business Activities
        The lending process is labor intensive and often inefficient. Zest AI attempts to solve this problem by using machine learning models which any bank can customize to automate the decision and fraud detection process. The intended customers banks and credit unions. They, like endless others in this space seek to automate the loan decisioning process.

    ## Landscape
        Zest AI is in the banking space. Workers in the space are desperate for inovation and a reduction in manual labor; while regualtory agencies hate technology and would rather humans with experience make all decions. Many companies are working on auto-decisioning tools to comply with fair lending guidelines. 

    ## Results 
        Zest AI boasts more than $1 trillion in loan originations on their website. THey also have partnerships with other banking technology tools which is critical.

    ## Recommendations

        I would continue to decieve banks into thinking that they can gain efficiencies while auditors and regulators push for more manual internal controls. Why actually solve a problem when you can just pretend to.
